<b>WC_IPADDRESS (SysIPAddress32) for .Net</b></br></br>

More than twenty years ago, Microsoft developed a library to facilitate and standardize the task of developers in implementing their applications. In it they were encapsulated a common set of controls in order that the developer be devoted to the intricacies of the heart of your application, leaving the user interaction to a simple, easy and simple implementation of such controls.</br>
With the advent of technology and the .NET CLR (15 years ago), he is further facilitated this deployment. For example, to interact with the user and present the data in a database used a ListView control, without creating this interface.</br>
It is at least curious that the only control is not included in .NET, is WC_IPADDRESS (SysIPAddress32), and even more curious that in all this time there is developed a usable, simple and easy implementation of it, especially considering the type of usefulness: interact with the user on one of the most basic aspects of TCP / IP networks: your IP address.</br></br>

This imlementación intended as an approach to this easy and simple implemetation.</br></br>

From the technical point of view, we have chosen to build on a TextBox and using class inheritance, implement funcionaidades included in the original library Common control.</br></br>

The Form class in .NET does not have the same characteristics as a dialog box. This means that Windows does not correctly interpret the keystrokes for navigation through the various controls.
That is why certain Properties are invalidated, in addition to the necessary elements subclass.</br></br>
